# E2E testing in Bootkube
Bootkube E2E tests are currently done by a tool called pluton. This subtree of bootkube vendors pluton so that bootkube tests can be maintained here and be versioned along-side bootkube releases. Nothing in this subtree should import any code from the rest of the bootkube tree and visa-versa.

For more information about use of this tool please see the [upstream README.md] (https://github.com/coreos/mantle/blob/master/pluton/README.md).

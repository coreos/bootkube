# Bootkube

Bootkube is a helper tool for launching self-hosted Kubernetes clusters.

When launched, bootkube will act as a temporary Kubernetes control-plane (api-server, scheduler, controller-manager), which operates long enough to bootstrap a replacement self-hosted control-plane.

Additionally, bootkube can be used to generate all of the necessary assets for use in bootstrapping a new cluster. These assets can then be modified to support any additional configuration options.

## Usage

Bootkube has two main commands: `render` and `start`

### Render assets

Bootkube can be used to render all of the assets necessary for bootstrapping a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster. This includes generation of TLS assets, Kubernetes object manifests, and a kubeconfig to connect to the bootstrapped cluster.

To see available options, run:

```
bootkube render --help
```

Example:

```
bootkube render --asset-dir=my-cluster
```

The resulting assets can be inspected / modified in the generated asset-dir.

### Start bootkube

To start bootkube use the `start` subcommand.

To see available options, run:

```
bootkube start --help
```

Example:

```
bootkube start --asset-dir=my-cluster
```

## Upgrading

** This tool is currently a proof-of-concept and not meant to update a production cluster. **

To upgrade a cluster, use the `hack/update-cluster` script. The script allows you to pass configuration via
environment variables. For more information on the configuration, refer to the script itself. All configuration
is initialized at the top of the script.

## Building

First, clone the repo into the proper location in your $GOPATH:

```
go get -u github.com/coreos/bootkube
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos/bootkube
```

Then, to build:

```
make
```

And optionally, to install into $GOPATH/bin:

```
make install
```

## Conformance Tests

This repository includes scripts for running the Kubernetes conformance tests agains the [hack/single-node](hack/single-node) and [hack/multi-node](hack/multi-node) launched clusters.

To run the conformance tests:

```
make conformance-single
```

or

```
make conformance-multi
```
